--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We designed our app with a minimalistic approach so that it can be used by a wider range of people. Since we are utilizing hand gestures rather than the keyboard or mousepad, we focused on people who have access to web cameras and can make such hand gestures.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
A custom gesture we created was one open hand and one closed hand, which updated the user score. Another custom gesture we made was one open hand and one hand pointing, which updated all game statistics: user score, total number of games, and computer score.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
Our app implements a useful initial view, error prevention, and it follows platform conventions.
